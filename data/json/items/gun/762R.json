    "description": "A later produced and substantially shortened version of Imperial Russia’s original service rifle, this variant of the Mosin features a notably more compact barrel and an integral side-folding bayonet.  Produced during the latter days of the Second World War for the Soviet Union, the weapon exhibits less overall stopping power than its full-length older brother thanks to the former’s stubbier barrel.  Despite the arm being somewhat weaker than its forefather, the 7.62x54mm round that it chambers still packs a hefty punch, whilst its smaller size helps to make the weapon wieldier.",

The weapon is tough, reliable, and sufficiently accurate for long-range squad support, and it became a well-regarded precision rifle across eastern Europe.  Like most other communist armaments, the Dragunov was a quite rare find in the US collector’s market, though its semi-automatic design made it a more feasible import than its automatic brethren.",
